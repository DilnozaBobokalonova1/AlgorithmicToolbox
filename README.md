# AlgorithmicToolbox
These are my solutions to the weekly programming assignments of the Algorithmic Toolbox taught by UC San Diego.
PLEASE do not copy my solutions. They are the result of hours of hard work. Try to come to solutions on your own. Go to the discussions on the weekly forums, as they have good advice regarding what could be wrong with your code. Use eclipse debugger if needed. But please do not copy.
