Given a sequence of non-negative integers a0,…,an−1, found the maximum pairwise product, that is, the largest integer 
that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence (or, more formally, max0≤i≠j≤n−1aiaj). 
Different elements here mean ai and aj with i≠j (it can be the case that ai=aj).
