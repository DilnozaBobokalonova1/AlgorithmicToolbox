Designed and implemented an efficient greedy algorithm for the following problems:
(a) changing money with a minimum number of coins;
(b) maximizing the total value of a loot;
(c) maximizing revenue in online ad placement;
(d) minimizing work while collecting signatures;
The solutions to all of the problems were my own. For (d), it ran in less than 0.3 seconds for all the tests given!
