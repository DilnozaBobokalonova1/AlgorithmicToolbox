problems:
(a) compute a small Fibonacci number;
(b) compute the last digit of a large Fibonacci number;
(c) compute a huge Fibonacci number modulo 𝑚;
(d) compute the last digit of a sum of Fibonacci numbers;
(e) compute the last digit of a partial sum of Fibonacci numbers;
(f) compute the greatest common divisor of two integers;
(g) compute the least common multiple of two integers.
